        <p>Almost six months have passed since it was announced all over the local news that new bills were on their ways to limit helicopters traffic -and noise- in NYC to essential needs and to crack down on private companies. Bills on this topic have been proposed at the city, state, and federal levels. None of them are even close to be voted as laws.</p>
        <p>Manhattan CB6 ranks 4th in the number of helicopter noise complaints. However, the heliport at 34th East has already been limited to essential flights 5 years ago (and no flight on the weekend) so little change should be expected there.</p>
